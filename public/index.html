            <div>
                <p>The Drink Visualizer is an intuitive way to show drinks with their
                    core ingredients. By interpreting the information sent by the sbuxAPI,
                    the visualizer can generate a picture that shows exactly what percentage
                    of the drink is sugary syrup and what part is coffee. This will help 
                    both partners and customers get a better understanding of what is going to
                    cups.
                </p>
                <p>When making these drinks, don't forget to add the love and care by hand from the heart!</p>

            <h2><a class="menu" href="http://localhost:8000/menu">Menu</a></h2>
            <div class="renderimages"><img src="#"></div>
            <div><p>The 'Menu' is a POS simulator. Using the API, partners can effectively: learn how to take actual customer
                orders, become familiar with the layout of the POS system, and become more comfortable asking questions to customers
                so they can make the moment right with every order. This project takes in many parameters to wholly simulate
                on-the-job scenarios, so partners feel comfortable before their first day on the floor.

                roasts. Complete with notes, flavors, and growing regions, the roasts page has
