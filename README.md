## How It's Made
**Tech Used**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Node.js

The project is essentially a database of drinks, customizations, and roasts that are held in the backend and interpreted by the front end. The Menu
page for example, takes in drink contents and names from the backend and makes them editable in the front end. Creating an accurate recreation of
POS. 

## Optimizations For POS
-Using Javascript to render the drink divs on the menu, I was able to stop hard-coding as many drinks into the front-end, and just let the front-end generate the layout of the divs.
